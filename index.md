Lachlan Donald
==============

Computer geek, coffee snob and cat lover. I'm CTO over at [99designs](http://99designs.com), living in San Francisco.

When I'm not exploring the world with my wife, Sarah, I'm building incredible web products and working 
with great teams of developers. I'm especially interested in scaling web applications and the business 
processes for creating them, cloud infrastructure, virtualization, distributed systems and test-driven 
development.
